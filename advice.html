 <h3 class="blue text-uppercase">Advice for Applicants</h3>
<br>

<p>Searching for the right job whilst still concentrating on your already busy career can be difficult, which is why our Recruitment Agency is here to help you do just that.  We also want to ensure that you make the right move too.  With this in mind we don’t try and sell you a job, we want you to make an informed decision - a career move and not a leap into the unknown.  Here is some initial advice to get you on your way:</p>

<p class="font-weight-bold">Before you begin</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you have a clear, well written CV and if you have more than one that they are consistent</li>

<li>Upload your CV online onto various job boards</li>

<li> Keep searching the Arlington Moore website and contact us by email when you are interested in a role</li>

<li>Don’t keep applying for irrelevant jobs</li>

<li>Ensure you are professional; Public websites such as facebook, email addresses, your answerphone message</li>  

 </ul>

<p>CV WRITING</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear and concise; Profile at the start containing a short synopsis of what you do, Skills and achievements (Bullet point some selected skills and achievements), Qualifications – List your relevant qualifications (If you don’t have many put this at the end), career to date in chronological order (most recent first) put your employment history including dates, company name and job titles as well as a list of responsibilities.  Personal details (Make sure your contact details are on your CV)</li>

<li>Profile - a brief description of you</li>

 

<p>The interview</p>

<li>Know where you are going and set off in good time</li>
<li>Ensure that you are wearing a clean smart suit or business dress</li>
<li>Shake hands with the interviewer as soon as you meet them</li>
<li>Make small talk as you are entering the interview</li>
<li>Answer questions concisely and to the point</li>
<li>At the end ask the interviewer if they have any questions at all</li>

<p>Examples of traditional Interview Questions</p>

<li>What is a typical week / month in your current / previous role?</li>
<li>Why did you leave your previous role?</li>
<li>What are your strengths and areas you need to improve on?</li>
<li>Why should we employ you?</li>
<li>Why do you want this job?</li>
<li>Why do you want to work for our company?</li>
<li>What do you know about our company?</li>

<p>You may also be asked situational or competency based questions where the interviewer will ask you to talk through a particular situation at work such as projects or situations with employees – ensure you have some to mind</p>

<p>TIPS TO INCREASE YOUR CAREER CHANCES</p>

<li>Keep learning – Learn whenever you can, relevant courses. Qualifications such as a degree may not make a difference to salary at the beginning of your career but the difference can be wide later on.</li>
<li>Gain new experience whenever you can – Take on new responsibilities</li>
<li>Network – Using your contacts and the internet</li>
<li>Update your knowledge by reading articles etc</li>
<li>Explore potential opportunities</li>
<li>Don’t burn bridges</li>
<li>Don't tell lies during the recruitment process!</li>
<li>Show willing and flexibility</li>
<li>Be careful what you place on public websites and social networking sites</li>
